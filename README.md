# Lab Website

**The Animal Body Plan Plasticity Lab (ABP<sup>2</sup>)** is a new group in the [Developmental Biology research unit](https://www.embl.de/research/units/dev_biology/) at EMBL Heidelberg, led by Aissam Ikmi.  We have an official EMBL [group page](https://www.embl.de/research/units/dev_biology/arendt/index.html), but we wanted to have an independent site where we could share a little more about who we are and what we do, one that would give a better feel for the group.  

So, that's the idea behind what's going on here.

The lab won't be officially up and running until October 2107, but we'll create the infrastructure for the site, starting off with pretty sparse content, and have it ready to build it up once we get rolling.
